# JSON middleware

The JSON middleware helps you in saving the content into the peer to peer distributed storage system as a json string.

### Middleware

You will have also an ability to define middleware to transform your storage content to the content you want for your application.

You register a middleware by providing a pattern when the middleware needs to be handled and the middleware implementation.
